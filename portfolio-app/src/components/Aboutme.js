                My name is Michael Bosse and I am a Wed Development Student, currently undertaking a Coding Bootcamp
                with Sydney University. 
                I am currenly a Civil Engineer, however I am looking to make a move into Web Development and thought
                this course would be helpful for me to achieve this goal. 
                Please take some time to look through my portfolio of projects and download my resume.
